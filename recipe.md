Step 1 -  Preheat the oven, grease a cake tin & beat butter with sugar :

To prepare this delicious cake, preheat the oven at 180 degrees Celsius. Then, take a cake tin and grease it with butter. On the other hand, beat the butter and powdered sugar until frothy.


Step 2  - Mix the ingredients, separately adding butter and eggs :

Now, in a large bowl, sieve all-purpose flour, salt, powdered sugar, baking powder and baking soda together. In a different bowl, add butter and beat until it becomes fluffy and frothy. Then break eggs one by one into the mixture and beat again.


Step 3 -  Add flour mixture to butter mixture :

Next, gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and beat to form a smooth batter. Then add vanilla essence to the mix and beat for another 2-3 minutes.


Step 4 - Pour batter in cake tin and bake for 40-45 minutes : 

When the batter is smooth, pour it into the cake tin and place it in the preheated oven. Bake for around 45 minutes or until the top turns golden brown and a fork inserted into the centre comes out clean.


Step 5 - Prepare the frosting & transfer to a piping bag :

While the cake bakes, prepare the frosting by beating the butter, icing sugar and vanilla essence in a large bowl. Beat until the texture is light and creamy, then transfer the frosting in a piping bag.
